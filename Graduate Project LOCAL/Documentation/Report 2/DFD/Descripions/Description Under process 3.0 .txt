“Process 3.0: Manage Book Exchange was decomposed into five sub-processes to reflect the student interactions in offering,
 viewing, and requesting books, including Give-for-Take exchanges. Each subprocess complies with the rules of DFD Level 1 as
 outlined by Kendall & Kendall, including at least one input, one output, and clearly labeled data flows using noun phrases. 
Associated data stores such as Book Offers, Book Requests, and Notifications are used meaningfully and non-redundantly.”
